    <h1>Born A Crime: Chapter 1&2 Summary</h1>

<p>Trevor, the author talks about the period way before apartheid when the black people<br>
    in South Africa were divided into tribes. Trevor’s mother is a devout Christian and<br>
    her unwavering faith in God does not let anything deter her from attending the Sunday <br>
    services. Trevor likes church but dislikes the hassle that comes with commuting to them.<br>
     One Sunday on their way to church, his mother and a bus driver get into an argument,<br> 
     which ends up with Patricia throwing Trevor out of the moving bus and jumping from it. </p>

<p>After the British rule ended, the Afrikaners took over the South African government. They <br>
    came up with a system of racial oppression that was known as apartheid. Patricia ran away <br>
    from home and went to live in Johannesburg. She met a Swiss expat with whom she sired a <br>
   child, despite it being illegal to have mixed-race children. In this chapter, Trevor said,<br>
   “While most children are proof of their parents’ love, I was proof of their criminality.”  <br>
   When he was around 17 years old, Trevor was shocked to find out that they had the option to <br>
   leave the country during apartheid but his mother did not want to.</p>

<p>I can relate the two chapters to how some of the people I know still have internalized<br>
     colonialism and treat white people better than their fellow Africans. It is sad to see <br>
     that most of them still have that mentality despite the fact that colonialism is over.</p>
